                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p>With the celebration of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) seventy-fifth year next season, it is quite been globalized since the first day of its foundation. From the United States to all over the world, fans are tuning in from preseason to offseason.

                        From this, I decided to make a site that can be reached by the fans all over the globe, to know what is happening inside and outside of the league.
                        
                        So, NBA fans, let us tune in.</p>
